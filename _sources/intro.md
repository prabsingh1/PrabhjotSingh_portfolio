Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! I am a born and raised East Coaster that recently transplanted out West. I have 5+ years of experience in utilizing data to unravel intiricate patterns, streamline complex tasks into elegant solutions, and provide predictive capabilities with business impact in a diversity of domains. 

Currently I am seeking out new job opportunities that will continue to help me grow in data science and machine learning career. So if you are a recuriter or team tyring to see if I could be a good fit, take a look at some of my relevant previous work experiences!


## Work Experiences
```{dropdown} Data Scientist | Healthcare Risk Advisors | New York, NY | 07/2022 – Present
• Developed, deployed and productionalized **classical supervised scikit-learn regression and classification models** on **Azure Databricks** to aid claims teams in prioritization and resourcing high-risk malpractice cases with 75% accuracy.  

• Engineered, fine-tuned, and interpreted **large language models (LLM)** and other **deep learning** pipelines using **pytorch, tensorflow, keras, transformers, and huggingface_hub** packages to predict adverse patient outcomes that was less than 1% of the population.  

• Conducted **hypothesis tests** by devising complex **Spark SQL** queries to analyze electronic health records (EHR), claims, demographic and legal data, leading to the discovery of over 150 statistically significant indicators of various target variables.  

• Designed innovative **unsupervised learning** approach to objectively target hospitals that are 90% similar to other hospitals, using distance metrics and clustering methods calculated with 20 demographic, clinical, and financial features.  

• Collaborated with engineering, product development, and client facing teams by performing regular data labeling, manipulating, and exploration using **pandas and numpy** to enhance Power BI dashboards, data models, and feature stores.   

• Delivered technical presentations to cross-functional stakeholders on a monthly cadence by interpreting from LLMs and creating concise and understandable visualizations using **shap, alibi,seaborn and plotly** packages to illustrate rigorous testing methods, rationale for increased model adoption, and actionable insights to inform future decision-making.  

• Led and mentored 3 summer interns in data science, statistics, and visualization techniques, guiding them through impactful short-term projects that led to process improvements across 2 different departments  

```

```{dropdown} Senior Data Analyst | Capital One | Mclean, VA | 06/2021 – 06/2022
• Spearheaded 5 data analytics initiatives in internal audit, examining over 200 risks and controls across international and domestic products by writing extensive data analytical reports that identified key patterns through intricate **SQL queries** within a massive **snowflake database**.  

• Programmed software enhancements to **algorithms** in python by improving sampling methodologies that leveraged **webscraping** tools such as **selenium and beautifulsoup** reducing overall document compilation time by over 50%.  

• Conducted code reviews of lengthy scripts over 5000 lines of SAS, SQL, and python used on integral systems to improve infrastructure around business retention, leading to a 5% reduction in detected false positives.  

```


```{dropdown} Management and Support Intern | Get the Medications Right Institute | Tysons, VA | 09/2019 – 03/2020
