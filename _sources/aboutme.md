# My Journey into Data Science  

My journey into the world of data science traces back to my childhood fascination with weather. I spent countless hours analyzing radar images and weather forecasts, attempting to decipher the intricate atmospheric patterns driving phenomena like tornadoes and hurricanes. This early fascination ignited my passion for complex sciences. While my path ultimately diverged from meteorology, my curiosity remained undiminished.

Parallel to my fascination with severe weather forecasting was my intrigue with the complexities of medicine and healthcare. This curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of Virginia. Throughout my undergraduate years, I immersed myself in various clinical and psychology labs, serving as a Research Assistant and Technician.

In the Early Social Development Lab, I conducted research studies aimed at unraveling the evolution of morality in infants and toddlers. This experience exposed me to foundational elements of hypothesis formulation and statistical testing. I also gained practical experience in data validation and analysis using tools like Excel, SPSS, and R. Subsequently, in a Clinical Trials lab within a Neuro-Oncology Department, I continued to apply these skills, this time focusing on identifying statistically significant outcomes in drug and treatment regimens. This experience left a lasting impression on the critical role of data in advancing solutions for diseases like cancer.

My initial trajectory pointed toward medical school, but a pivotal internship at the Get the Medications Right Institute (GTMRx) shifted my path. As a Management and Program Support Intern at GTMRx, I collaborated with healthcare non-profit organizations, startups, and industry leaders, all dedicated to solving the myriad challenges in healthcare. My responsibilities ranged from managing meetings and recording minutes for workgroups to researching healthcare institutions and conducting survey-based analytics. Through this experience, a common theme emerged: healthcare is in dire need of transformation. The emergence of COVID-19 underscored the urgency for change, with even the most effective healthcare systems grappling with unprecedented challenges. It became evident that a solution lies in smarter decision support tools, powered by machine learning and the wealth of information within electronic health records (EHRs).

Driven by this revelation, my interest in medicine evolved into a profound fascination with data. I pursued a Master's in Data Science, once again at the University of Virginia, where I engaged in a comprehensive curriculum that included courses in Linear Modeling, Data Mining, Bayesian Machine Learning, Ethics of Big Data, and more. For my capstone project, I collaborated with fellow MSDC students and the UVA Oncology Department to investigate Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia, a rare disease. Equipped with this robust education, I have successfully leveraged predictive modeling and advanced statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights from diverse datasets. 



Immediately after my Data Science program, I served as a Senior Data Analyst at Capital One, where I played a pivotal role in supporting the internal audit team. By generating analytical and predictive insights, I fortified regulatory and audit findings, contributing to a culture of data-driven decision-making. After this, I took on a role as a dedicated Data Scientist at Healthcare Risk Advisors, specializing in Medical Malpractice Insurance. In this role, I harness a unique blend of electronic health records, historical claims data, and legal insights to construct predictive models. These models enable us to anticipate future outcomes in medical malpractice cases, ultimately reducing risks and enhancing the quality of care.

Beyond this, my portfolio features personal projects that align with other interests, including healthcare, meteorology, and even sports analytics. Recently, fantasy football has been of particular interest, given the vastness of data that is available and my own competitive spirit leading me to explore data-driven strategies to gain an edge over my friends..
