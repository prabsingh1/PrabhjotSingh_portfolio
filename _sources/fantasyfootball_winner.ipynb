    "### Defining Goal - Target and Intermediate Target Variables\n",
    "Success in a fantasy football league can be guaged in a variety of ways - but we only care about one thing: winning the whole thing. Therefore the main target variable will indicate for any given team in a given year, whether or not they won: \n",
    "\n",
    "- LeagueWin_Binary: Indicator of League Win or Not\n",
    "\n",
    "However, considering there is only 1 winner every year and the league has only been active since 2016, a major flaw to the model could be an incredibly imbalanced dataset. In addition, I fear that there is a lot of variablity in winning that can be attribtued to plain luck. Therefore anticipating the difficulty in predicting a leauge win or not, I will also be including a list of some intermediate target variables that may serve as an alternative measure of success: \n",
    "\n",
    "- LeagueWin_Categorical: Categorical Variable that divides the final standings into 4 different groups: Group1: Place 1-3, Group2: Place:3-6, Group3: 6-9, and Group4: 9-12.\n",
    "- LeaguePlayoffStandings_Categorical: Final playoff standings.\n",
    "- LeaguePlayoff_Binary: Whether or not a team made the playoffs. \n",
    "- LeagueTotalPoints_Numerical: Numerical variable for total points scored in regular season\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the Features  \n",
    "There are an abundance of ways in which we can extrapolate \"draft strategies\", but I will be focused on type of position and ADP pre-season ranks of position picked in the various different rounds. Although it would be difficult to write a comprehensive list of all variables, here are some of the features I am interested in manufacturing. \n",
    "\n",
    "- FirstOverallPick_Pos - LastOverallPick_Pos: For each round, a variable indicating the position that was drafted, and the overall ranking that the player had. \n",
    "- OrderofPositionPicks_5Rounds: A sequential list of positions that were drafted from the first 5 rounds.\n",
    "- AverageDraftPick_Position: The average of all the picks by a position. \n",
    "- NumberRookiePicks: Integer number of rookie selections.\n",
    "- AverageAgeofPicks: Float age of overall team. \n",
    "- DiversityTeams: How many different divisions are present in the team. \n",
    "- ByeWeekDifferential: Variance of bye weeks. \n",
    "- HandcuffPicks: If a player from the same team and position are selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the focus on this first part will be on creating the first bullet point of variables and seeing how picks can be used to make predictive insights. Beyond that, I would also like to emphasize how important the step iof creating reliable and accurate data is as a data scientist/machine learning engineer. Yes our job is to create models and pipelines, but these outputs are entirely dependent on how clean and ready the inputted variables are. Therefore, I always take the time to massage and manufacture variables that I believe are accurately capturing intersting aspect of the problem at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I find it helpful to understand problems in terms of dataframes. As a visual learner and data practicioner that relies heavily on pandas dataframes, I am able to better engineer data when I have a *final dataframe* that I am working towards. Therefore, in this case, I would envision the final dataframe looking something like this:w"

    "As with every data science project, the first step is to actually acquire the data. Although, I don't want to just amatuerly copy and paste data into an excel file. Therefore isntead, I am going to be relying on the poorly documented ESPN API to assemble the data. would much rather create a webscraper to do this for me. In order to do this, I will need to leverage a combination APIs with some \"cookies\" that are needed to login to my private league.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, its a bit tricky locating cookies, but I highly recommend visiting some of the resources that I have listed, but I found this [tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ffscrapr/vignettes/espn_authentication.html) from Tan Ho the most helpful. From this you can see the two main cookies you need are the swid, and espn_s2. Just save those as a variable - as it is needed whenever submitting a get request to the ESPN APIs. "

    "Now that we have our index, the next step is to craft the features. The best way to approach this is to just go down the list of some of the ideas that were described earlier. By tackling each of those ideas one at a time, it makes the process of engineering features a lot less intimidating. So first on the list is creating a variable that captures each of the picks in the draft:  \n",
